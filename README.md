## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly


## My Process
I started off by structuring my HTML first, then I settled to start with the mobile version first in CSS before adapting it to desktop.
Only after I was done did I start working on my JavaScript code.

## JavaScript 
- Retrieved the elements I wanted to work on in JavaScript (the input field, the error message and the error icon which are both hidden)
- used an event listener for a change in the input field and created a function which retrieves the user's input, compares it with the email format.
- Used an if statement to check if the user's input is valid or if it is invalid.


### Built with
- Flex box
- Mobile-first workflow
- HTML 5
- JavaScript
